# nginx-proxy for ARM

Based on [nginx-proxy from jwilder](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy).

For sample usage see the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/rycus86/docker-arm-nginx-proxy/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file or
have a look at the following repos:
- https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy (nginx + docker-gen as a single container)
- https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen (for automatic nginx configuration)
- https://github.com/rycus86/docker-pygen (as an alternative to docker-gen)
